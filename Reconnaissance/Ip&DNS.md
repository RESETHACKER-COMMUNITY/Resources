WHOIS : (Domain owners by same organizations or company)
Reverse Whois:
DNS Information:
Reverse DNS :
Reverse Name server:
Reverse Mail server:

Favicon hash : calculate hash of a site's favicon and submit it in tools such as Shodan.io,  
you can find more domains that have the same favicon and could potentially be owned by the same company.
