Extension Burp :
       
       BurpBountty Pro
       Burp Extension to bypass 403 restriction:
       I have seen payloads it uses to bypass are
       ["%2e/"+LastPath, LastPath+"/.", "./"+LastPath+"/./", LastPath+"%20/", "%20"+LastPath+"%20/", LastPath+"..;/"] and header manipulation,  you can add some-more on to it to have different result

      BurpSuite extension HaE(highlighter and extractor) is already on the shelf in the BApp Store.
      I think this is a valuable extension for bugbounty hunters, you can use it and see its charm.
