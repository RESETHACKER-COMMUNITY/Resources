# JAVASCRIPT FOR HACKER

**JavaScript** (or JS for short) is a scripting language used by front end developers to implement and manage dynamic content. 
JavaScript was initially used only for the client-side but, in more recent times, it has also been used as a server-side programming language.

NOTE: 
1. Dynamic content includes animated graphics, interactive forms, photo carousels, etc.—anything you see when you’re visiting a website or using an app that “changes” on screen without you having to do a manual refresh.
The autocomplete feature that happens when you’re entering search terms into Google’s search bar? That’s JavaScript in action.
 
2. In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars, buttons, and anything else someone interacts with to USE a website or app.

## What is the role of JS frameworks and libraries ?
It give developers the ability to use prewritten code for common JavaScript functions, and to create their own functions that can then be reused as needed.

## Does that mean “library” and “framework” two ways of saying the same thing? 
Not really. Yes, both tools have similar uses, but there are significant differences between the scope and scale of the two platforms.

Examples of JavaScript Libraries:
    
    jQuery : DOM Manipulation
    React JS : User Interface framework
    Data-Driven Documents or D3.js( library to use when you are dealing with data. It manipulates the document based on the content and adds interactivity   with the help of HTML, SVG, and CSS. )
    TaffyDB : Database (JavaScript library that adds database features to our website.)

## Why do we use framework?
So a JavaScript Framework is an application skeleton, a complete structure that provides the programmer with the basic tools of creating a website or a web application. 
They consist of a huge collection of various JavaScript libraries that supplies the programmers with pre-written code and thus allows even those who don’t have a lot of programming knowledge.

Eg: We can easily understand a framework with the example of a collage maker. 

These applications have some photo frame ideas that you can choose from.

You just have to sit and decide which frame you like the most. 

You don’t have to position them all by yourself which provides faster results. But they have limited choices to select from.

Examples of some Popular Js frameworks:

    Angular :  Pros. Cons. Open Source. Single page applications. ...
    React : Pros. Cons. Easy to learn. Reusable components. ...
    Vue. js : Pros. Cons. ...
    Ember. js : Pros. Cons. ...
    Meteor : Pros. Cons. Offers several conveniences. ...
    Mithril : Pros. Cons. Lightweight. ...
    Node. js : Pros. Cons. ...
    Polymer : Pros. Cons. Good for single-page applications.
    
NotE: Today no one directly uses javascript instead they use a framework especially if you are a company.

### Understanding ReactJS


## Debugging Javascript code:
Open DevTools(right click and select intercept) > goto Netowrk > Select Js in the Options (Now you have all the Js files)

[Steal Info JS](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/steal-info-js)

If you know of an endpoint which returns 403 since it’s an admin endpoint but have you ever imagined knowing the correct directories and parameters sometimes can turn 403 into 200 (because of misconfigurations) and then into a SQLi? ;)
